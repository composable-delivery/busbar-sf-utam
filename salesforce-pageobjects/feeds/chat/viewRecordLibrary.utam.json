            "This Lightning Web Component (LWC) seems to be a utility library that provides functions for processing and transforming record data for display in a UI, particularly in a list view. It includes functions to unenrich records, get massaged records, generate field information, extract metadata, and determine if a record is enriched. The component does not directly render a user interface but supports other components that do.",
